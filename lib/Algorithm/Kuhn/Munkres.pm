=head1 NAME

Algorithm::Kuhn::Munkres - Determines the maximum weight perfect matching in a weighted complete bipartite graph


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Algorithm::Kuhn::Munkres version 1.0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Algorithm::Kuhn::Munkres;

    my @matrix = ([1,2,3,4],[2,4,6,8],[3,6,9,12],[4,8,12,16]);
    my ($cost,$mapping) = assign(@matrix);
 
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

    Implementation of the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. The algorithm finds the maximum weight
    perfect matching in a weighted complete bipartite graph. This problem is also known as 
    the "Assignment Problem".

=head1 INTERFACE 

=over 4

=item max_weight_perfect_matching

Determines the maximum weight perfect matching in a weighted complete bipartite graph.
The single argument is a matrix representing the weights of the edges in the bipartite graph.
The matrix must be implemented as a list of array objects.
The output is a tuple consisting of the total weight (cost) of the perfect matching, and
a reference to a hash representing edges in the mapping.

    use Algorithm::Kuhn::Munkres;

    my @matrix = ([1,2,3,4],[2,4,6,8],[3,6,9,12],[4,8,12,16]);
    my ($cost,$mapping) = assign(@matrix);

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

    Ideally, I would list every single error and warning message that the module can
    generate (even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full
    explanation of each problem, one or more likely causes, and any
    suggested remedies. I'm not that good a person right now.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Algorithm::Kuhn::Munkres requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

List::Util

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES
